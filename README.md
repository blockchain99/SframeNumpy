### installation and usage

Program is written in python 2.7, it one may need anaconda shoulde be installed(including numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter) ( https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install ) or install python 2.7 and then install Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, matplotlib,jupyter manually as follows.

sudo pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
After anaconda installed , one may need to jupyter run, by type in command line and hit the enter.

Then install GlaphLab 
* install GraphLab Create from site https://turi.com/download/install-graphlab-create.html

> jupyter notebook

and then upload and select ipynb file in web page.
